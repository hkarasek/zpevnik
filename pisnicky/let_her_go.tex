\emph{
Well, you only need the \chord{F}light when it's burning \chord{C}low\\
Only miss the \chord{G}sun when it starts to \chord{Am}snow\\
Only know you \chord{F}love her when you let her \chord{C G}go\\
Only know you've been \chord{F}high when you're feeling \chord{C}low\\
Only hate the \chord{G}road when you're missin' \chord{Am}home\\
Only know you \chord{F}love her when you let her \chord{C}go\\
\chord{G}And you let her go\\
}

[Instrumental]\\
\textbf{Am F G Em}\\
\textbf{Am F G}\\

\chord{Am}Staring at the bottom of your \chord{F}glass\\
Hoping \chord{G}one day you will make a dream \chord{Em}last\\
The dreams come \chord{Am}slow and they go \chord{F}so fast\chord{G}\\
You see her when you close your eyes\\
Maybe one day you will understand why\\
Everything you touch surely dies\\

Staring at the ceiling in the dark\\
Same old empty feeling in your heart\\
Love comes slow and it goes so fast\\
Well you see her when you fall asleep\\
But to never to touch and never to keep\\
Because you loved her too much\\
And you dived too deep\\
